# Auth API Example

This is just a basic version of my old api that i used to use for authentication 

# Setup 

This doesnt require Apache2 
you will need Node.JS and a website or domain 

put your SSL certs in the SSL Folder

drop files in a folder on your server and run `node Main.js`

put a file named index.html a folder Called Public (This is what people visiting your website will see)
